				<h4>ELECTRICITY</h4>
				<p>Most households and small businesses pay time-of-use electricity prices that appear on the “Electricity” line of the bill. As the regulator, the OEB sets electricity prices twice a year: May 1 and November 1. Prices are based on the estimated cost to supply electricity in the province for the next six months.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>DELIVERY</h4>
				<p>This is made up of two separate costs. Both are approved by the OEB.</p>

				<h5>1. TRANSMISSION</h5>
				<p>Power flows from Ontario power plants and other sources, through transmission lines, to your local utility. Every home in Ontario pays the same rate to cover these costs.</p>

				<h5>2. DISTRIBUTION</h5>
				<p>A distribution company (also called “distributor” or “localutility”) delivers electricity to homes and businesses througha network of power lines within the communities it serves.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>REGULATORY</h4>
				<p>This is made up of the costs to administer the wholesale electricity system and maintain the reliability of the provincial grid. It also includes costs for funding Ministry of Energy conservation, renewable and low-income energy programs.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h4>GLOBAL ADJUSTMENT AND ENERGY CONTRACTS</h4>
				<p>If you buy electricity from your utility, the electricity pricealready includes your share of the “Global Adjustment.” <strong>If you sign a contract with an energy retailer, you pay the agreed-upon contract price (not time-of-use or tiered prices set by the OEB). You will also need to pay your share of the Global Adjustment.</strong> It will appear as a new, separate line on your utility bill.</p>

			<h2> Time of Use Electricity Prices </h2>
			<p>Households and small businesses in Ontario pay time-of-use prices for electricity that change according to the
			<span>Time of Day</span> and <span>day of the week</span>.The peak periods also change by <span>season</span>.Your smart meter tells your utility exactly how much power you use and when you use it. With this information, your utility charges you for the amount of power you use at off-peak, mid-peak and on-peak times.</p>  
			<h3> Reasons for Different Prices</h3>
			<p><span> When Demand is Low </span>
			and fewer people are using power, lower-cost electricity is available from sources like nuclear and large hydroelectric systems.
			</p>
			<p><span> When demand rises </span>
				during the day, the province’s supply of lower-cost electricity is used up, and more expensive sources need to be used. 
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
		<!-- this section should show the circle graphs explaining peak hours -->
			<!-- STEP FOUR create this section using SVGs - the first two can be vectors, but create the last circle graph programmatically - a few hints, you can create text and curves with SVG and can also write on a curve. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial will be a big help -->
